# Torr-pi
A 24*7 on downloading machine!
Because when it comes to downloading files from torrents, always on machine is a king. but we are well aware just how much energy an always-on desktop machine or home server sucks down. How many times we have to keep our system ON  because any torrent file is getting download? this problem is more of a disaster if we are downloading a large file or a very rare file with only few seeders. Hence this project idea is shift the burden of torrenting off your main desktop machine to a Raspberry Pi, which is built like a mobile processor who consume energy very less and sip by sip. The core Raspberry Pi board uses less than $3 of energy per year and even after adding in a few external hard drives, youâ€™ll still keep your yearly operating costs at less than a cup of coffee!
