# Torr-pi
A 24*7 on downloading machine!
Because when it comes to downloading files from torrents, always on machine is a king. but we are well aware just how much energy an always-on desktop machine or home server sucks down. How many times we have to keep our system ON  because any torrent file is getting download? this problem is more of a disaster if we are downloading a large file or a very rare file with only few seeders. Hence this project idea is shift the burden of torrenting off your main desktop machine to a Raspberry Pi, which is built like a mobile processor who consume energy very less and sip by sip. The core Raspberry Pi board uses less than $3 of energy per year and even after adding in a few external hard drives, you’ll still keep your yearly operating costs at less than a cup of coffee!

INTRODUCTION TO RASPBERRY PI
The Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized computer designed and manufactured by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to making computers and programming instruction as accessible as possible to the widest number of people.Introduced in 2012, the original Raspberry Pi (what we now refer to as the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A) featured a system-on-a-chip setup built around the Broadcom BCM2835 processor–a tiny but fairly powerful mobile processor commonly used in cellphones. It included a CPU, GPU, audio/video processing, and other functionality all on a low-power chip paired with a 700Mhz single core ARM processor. Over the intervening years the foundation has released multiple revisions (switching out the Broadcom chips for improved versions and upping the CPU power with a 1.2GHz quad-core chip).

The current generation Raspberry Pi 3, seen above, sports the following hardware:

1.2 Ghz ARM processor Systems-On-a-Chip (SoC) with integrated 1GB RAM.
1 HDMI port for digital audio/video output
1 3.5mm jack that offers both audio and composite video out (when paired with an appropriate cable).
4 USB 2.0 ports for connecting input devices and peripheral add-ons.
1 microSD card reader for loading the operating system.
1 Ethernet LAN port.
1 Integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth radio antenna.
1 microUSB power port.
1 GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) interface.
